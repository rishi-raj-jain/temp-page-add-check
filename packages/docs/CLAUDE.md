## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) — hosted documentation platform
- **Content**: MDX (Markdown + JSX) files
- **API Docs**: Auto-generated from OpenAPI 3.0 spec via custom Node.js script
- **Formatting**: Prettier (JSON, MD, MDX)
- **Git Hooks**: Husky (pre-commit formatting)
- **Deployment**: Automatic via Mintlify GitHub App on push to `main`

---

## Agent Execution Rules

> These rules must be strictly enforced at all times.

1. **Do not ignore or skip instructions.** Every rule must be followed.
2. **Do not hallucinate.** Only generate content backed by this context and actual Creem product knowledge.
3. **Validate every output** against these rules before finalizing.
4. **Use only approved patterns, conventions, and structures.**
5. If a rule conflicts with a general best practice, **prioritize the custom rule** defined here.
6. Be **predictable, repeatable, and rule-compliant** — not creative with structure.

---

## Development Commands

```bash
# Preview docs locally
mintlify dev

# Format all content files
npm run format

# Check formatting without changes
npm run format:check

# Generate API reference MDX from local openapi.json
npm run generate:api

# Generate from remote API, update local spec, and clean orphans
npm run generate:api:remote -- https://api.creem.io/open-api/json

# Preview API doc generation without writing files
npm run generate:api:dry-run

# Delete orphaned endpoint MDX files
npm run generate:api:cleanup
```

---

## Mintlify Configuration

The `docs.json` file is the primary configuration. It controls:

- **Navigation**: Three tabs — Documentation, Guides, API Reference
- **Theme**: Mint theme with Peach (#FFBE98) primary and Lavender (#B09CFB) dark accent
- **SEO**: Open Graph, Twitter cards, keywords
- **Analytics**: PostHog integration
- **Contextual menu**: copy, view, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity
- **Footer**: X (@creem_io), LinkedIn socials
- **Navbar**: Support link, llms.txt, llms-full.txt, Creem homepage button

### Navigation Structure

| Tab | Groups |
|-----|--------|
| **Documentation** | Get Started, AI, Features, Code, Integrations, Community, Merchant of Record, For Customers |
| **Guides** | Step-by-step tutorials (create product, create checkout, FAQ) |
| **API Reference** | Introduction, Error Codes, Checkout, Product, Customer, Transactions, License, Discount Code, Subscription |

### Adding a New Page

1. Create the `.mdx` file in the appropriate directory
2. Add the page path to `docs.json` under the correct group in `navigation.tabs`
3. Pages are referenced by their file path without extension (e.g., `features/discounts` for `features/discounts.mdx`)

### Page Frontmatter

Every MDX page needs frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: 'Page Title'
description: 'Brief description of the page content.'
icon: 'icon-name'  # Optional — Font Awesome icon name
---
```

---

## API Reference Documentation

### Source of Truth

The OpenAPI 3.0 spec authored at `../creem-sdk/openapi.json` (workspace-shared with the SDK generator) is the single source of truth. `api-reference/openapi.json` is a **generated copy** kept in sync by `pnpm gen:sdk` so Mintlify can auto-discover it for the API playground — don't edit it directly.

Deployed backend Swagger JSON is exposed at `/open-api/json`, for example `https://api.creem.io/open-api/json`, `https://test-api.creem.io/open-api/json`, and `https://stg-api.creem.io/open-api/json`. The private backend's local/sandbox Swagger setup may expose `/open-api/json` when run with `APP_ENVIRONMENT=local` or `APP_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox`.

For backend schema changes, fix the private backend annotations first, regenerate `../creem-sdk/openapi.json`, run `speakeasy run` from `../creem-sdk`, then copy the spec to `api-reference/openapi.json`. Do not manually patch generated SDK files or the public OpenAPI spec for backend schema changes. Check that the SDK package version was not bumped unless a release is intentional.

Speakeasy requires an authenticated CLI session and network access. If generation changes the package version unexpectedly, restore the intended version before committing.

### How API Docs Are Generated

The `scripts/generate-api-docs.js` script:
1. Reads the OpenAPI spec (local file or remote URL)
2. Generates/updates MDX files in `api-reference/endpoint/`
3. Only touches frontmatter (title, description, openapi reference)
4. **Preserves any custom content** you add below the frontmatter

### Generated Endpoint MDX Format

```yaml
---
title: 'Creates a new product'
description: 'Create a new product for one-time payments, including free products with a 0 price, or subscriptions.'
openapi: post /v1/products
---

## Custom Content Here

Any content below the frontmatter is preserved across regenerations.
```

### Filename Overrides

The script has a `FILENAME_OVERRIDES` map for custom filenames. If an operationId doesn't produce a good filename, add an override in `scripts/generate-api-docs.js`.

### Updating API Docs After Backend Changes

When the backend API changes:

1. Deploy or run the backend locally to expose the updated OpenAPI spec
2. Run: `npm run generate:api:remote -- https://api.creem.io/open-api/json` (or sandbox URL)
3. Review the generated changes
4. Add the new endpoint page path to `docs.json` navigation if it's a new endpoint
5. Commit both the updated `openapi.json` and any new/changed MDX files

## Creem Business Context

Understanding the business is essential for writing accurate documentation.

### What Creem Does

Creem is a **Merchant of Record (MoR)** — the legal entity that sells digital products on behalf of merchants. This means:
- Creem handles payment processing, tax collection, compliance, and chargebacks
- Merchants integrate via API and receive payouts
- End-customers see "Creem" (or white-labeled) as the seller on their receipts

### Core Product Areas

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Payments** | One-time and recurring payments via checkout sessions |
| **Subscriptions** | Full lifecycle — create, upgrade, pause, resume, cancel |
| **Tax Compliance** | Automatic VAT/GST collection for 190+ countries |
| **License Keys** | Software licensing with activation, validation, deactivation |
| **Revenue Splits** | Programmable payment splitting between multiple recipients |
| **Affiliates** | Built-in affiliate/referral program infrastructure |
| **Discounts** | Coupon codes with percentage or fixed-amount discounts |
| **Customer Portal** | Self-service portal for subscription and billing management |
| **Storefronts** | Hosted product pages for merchants |
| **Webhooks** | Event notifications for all payment lifecycle events |

### Target Audience

The documentation serves:
- **Developers** integrating Creem via API or SDKs
- **Solopreneurs / Indie hackers** selling digital products
- **AI tool creators** needing fast payment integration
- **SaaS founders** managing subscriptions
- **End customers** with billing questions

| checkouts | checkouts:read | checkouts:write |
| products | products:read | products:write |
| customers | customers:read | customers:write |
| subscriptions | subscriptions:read | subscriptions:write |
| transactions | transactions:read | — |
| licenses | licenses:read | licenses:write |
| discounts | discounts:read | discounts:write |

## Content Guidelines

### Tone & Voice

- **Professional but friendly** — developer-focused, not overly corporate
- **Clear and concise** — get to the point, avoid filler
- **Practical** — lead with code examples and concrete use cases
- **Authoritative** — be precise when discussing tax, compliance, or legal topics

### Writing Standards

- Use **second person** ("you") when addressing the reader
- Use **present tense** ("Creem handles" not "Creem will handle")
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences max)
- Lead sections with the most important information
- Include code examples wherever relevant
- Use tables for structured reference data
- Use admonitions (Note, Warning, Tip, Info) for callouts

### Mintlify Components
